## Notes

The only real challenge of this project was learning the different language key words. I am used to Java so moving to HTML, CSS, and JS was a little confusing at first. However, with the help of other forums and the forum provided I was able to complete the project on top of getting an introduction to 3 very important languages. I really enjoyed this project :).
