## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

https://syntaxdb.com

https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/javascript/

Talked to my friend, a full stack dev, about the fundamentals of these languages. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The only real challenge of this project was learning the different language key words. I am used to Java so moving to HTML, CSS, and JS was a little confusing at first. However, with the help of other forums and the forum provided I was able to complete the project on top of getting an introduction to 3 very important languages. Additionally, one specific example was trying to center align the title and the description. I wasnt familiar with the proper functions I could use to align things in CSS. After spending some time on google I was able to figure it out. However, I was still unable to center align the start button. I also attmpted to implement the random pattern, but was not able to figure out.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

From this project, what would be considered the front end, and what would be considered the back end? If applicable.
What is your favorite aspect of web dev?
Are there any things that you dislike in the web dev field?
When Flash was pulled, how, if at all, did that change web dev?
What are your thoughts on Web3, and how will that impact web dev, if at all?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had more time to work on this project, I would work on implementing the optional features that were suggested. I'll probably end up going back and doing them anyways so I can learn more about the 3 languages. The features that stood out to me the most were implementing pictures for each button. As well as I wouldve also liked to add the feature where the pattern is random every time; I tried, but was not able to fully figure it out.
